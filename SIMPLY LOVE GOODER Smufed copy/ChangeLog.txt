ChangeLog (Version 8 - "Bugs Glaore")

- Graphics Issue
	Weird and small bug that happend when entering the graphics menu and the game would instantly crash

- More Options
	This feature is a recreation of dbk2's jfonts workaround.
	Now the theme can display many japanese and korean characters without any issues.

- Fixed issues with Wineskin
	Quick Start and a Discord button has been added to the game
	Also the funny Nothing. Button

- Updated Textures
	I updated a few textures to make the theme overall look nicer

- Typo?
	Nope! Beter is here to stay
	

This is going to be barely continued, as im only going to fix some game breaking bugs and maybe a few things cosmeticly.

- SMUFED
