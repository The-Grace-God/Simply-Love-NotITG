# Simply-Love-NotITG
A theme made specifically for NotITG 

# Disclaimer:
- Even though i count this as my theme not all of this is mine in fact most of the credit goes to jose_varela as he's the person who made the theme this is based off ofim only reviving the project as the original creator stoped working on it 5 years ago.

# Installation 
- Put the "SIMPLY LOVE GOODER Smufed copy" in the themes directory,
- Boot the game,
- Got to settings,
- Theme options,
- And select "SIMPLY LOVE GOODER Smufed copy" in the menu (might have to scroll a bit if you have more than one theme).

# What does this theme support
- NotITG V4.3/4.2 as thats what this theme was mostly tested on.
- Keep in mind there alot of errors in this build and the next one will be way more stable but im just too lazy to fix them right now.
